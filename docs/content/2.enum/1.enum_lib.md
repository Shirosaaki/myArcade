# Enum Lib

## Definition

```
enum class TGraphics {
    NCURSES,
    SDL,
    NDK,
    AA,
    CACA,
    ALLEGRO,
    X,
    GTK,
    SFML,
    IRRLICHT,
    OPENGL,
    VULKAN,
    QT,
    NONE
};
```

## Why

This enum helps us determine whether the library the player wants to use exists.<br>
If the library is not in this enum, the program does not load it and displays an error.
