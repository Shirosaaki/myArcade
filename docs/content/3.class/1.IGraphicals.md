# IGraphical

## Declaration

```
class IGraphics {
    public:
        virtual ~IGraphics() = default;
        virtual void Init() = 0;
        virtual arcade::KeyBind getKey() = 0;
        virtual void Display(std::map<std::string, std::pair<std::pair<int, int>, std::pair<int, int>>> &entities) = 0;
        virtual void PlaySound(std::string sound) = 0;
        virtual void Clear() = 0;
        virtual void Nuke() = 0;

    private:
};

## Why

It's an interface for all graphical libraries.<br>
Below, we will go over all the functions and their purposes.

### Init

Initializes the library.

### getKey

Returns the key pressed to determine which action to perform.

### Display

Takes a map of elements to display. The key corresponds to the asset path or the text to be displayed.
* The first pair of integers represents the x and y position of the element.
